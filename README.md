# Klavar
This is an ancient GFA Basic program for ATARI ST. 
In origin was supposed to be a kind of Notepad for the easy-to-read KLAVAR music notation.
"Klavarskribo" (shortened "Klavar") is an alternative music notation coming from The Netherlands, where it is still popular.

The objective of the project would be to port the application to more modern environment.

I owe it to a old friend.
